# DemiOS-Text-Editor
This is a .py based text editor I made in a single day, part of the DemiOS package.
Anyways, this is licensed under the Creative Commons License Zero 1.0 Universal. So yeahhh, it's a pretty basic text editor so don't expect much out of it.
It was mostly made as a learning experience for myself, enjoy I guess!
